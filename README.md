# CamSlide
CamSlide is an Arduino based embedded system to slide a camera sideways on a guide rail for time-lapse shots.
There are several settings, which are set via a display and a 4-button user interface.

#####Please note:
Currently there is no external link, where you can see how the controller is wired, or how the mechanical engineering has to be done.
Also the software is not completed yet.
