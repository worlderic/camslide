# CamSlide
CamSlide is an Arduino based embedded system to slide a camera sideways on a guide rail for time-lapse shots.
The project was written in Sublime Text 3 and Stino ( https://github.com/Robot-Will/Stino ) with the Arduino IDE 1.6.6.

There are several settings, which are set via a display and a 4-button user interface:
- Way [mm]: How far the slide shall go.
- Delay [sec]: Time spawn between the single captures.
- Repeats [#]: How much pictures should be taken.
- Shutter Speed[sec]: The zime that the shutter is open.
- Auto-Focus & Mirror-Lockup [on/off]

##### Please note:
Currently there is no external link, where you can see how the controller is wired, or how the mechanical engineering has to be done.
